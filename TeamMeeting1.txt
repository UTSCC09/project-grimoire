Goals for Beta: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looking for Group:
Page where users can post groups looking for games or users can post their availability for games.
User can declare their desire for different types of games (exploration, action, suspense,...)
Groups can declare their game type (action, suspense, horror,...)
Users are referred to groups based on their preferences.
MongoDB implementation of database
Use vector norms ( :( ) to compare users and recommend how close they are 
Group owners should be able to change the games, add players, remove players, promote to Owner, and promote to DM.



Character Sheets:
Players can create character sheets, which are stored on DB, and are returned to them.
Players should be able to send character sheets to other players to see (whitelist people to be able to see their character sheets, only they are allowed to edit)
When players join a group, the DM of the group will be able to see the character sheet associated with that 
Character sheets are displayed on each page and can be seen and accessed by users.
Users can perform skill tests by typing a command in some sort of terminal (Ex: Body Check) (MaterialUI) (Physical Dice Rolling?)




Kyle:
Endpoints (Specific to each game?) and database design

Jason:
Start Looking for Groups Endpoints

Casper:
Start the frontend. Set terminal to allow users to roll different stats using commands like test Strength....
